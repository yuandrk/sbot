### Makefile Documentation for `kbot`

#### Variables

* `APP`: The name of the application, derived from the Git repository name.
* `REGISTRY`: The Docker registry where images will be pushed. Default is `ghcr.io/yuandrk`.
* `VERSION`: The application version, derived from Git tags and commit hash.
* `TARGETOS`: Target operating system for the build. Default is `linux`.
* `TARGETARCH`: Target architecture for the build. Default is `amd64`.

#### Commands

* **`format`**: Formats the Go code in the current directory.
    
    * Uses `gofmt` for formatting.
* **`get`**: Runs `go get` to download and install packages and dependencies.
    
* **`lint`**: Runs `golint` to check the Go source code for coding style mistakes.
    
* **`test`**: Runs tests for the Go code with verbose output.
    
* **`build`**: Builds the Go binary for the specified `TARGETOS` and `TARGETARCH`.
    
    * Disables CGO.
    * Sets the application version through linker flags.
* **`linux`**: Builds the Go binary for Linux and creates a Docker image.
    
    * Tags the image with the registry, app name, version, and architecture.
* **`windows`**: Builds the Go binary for Windows and creates a Docker image.
    
    * Tags the image similarly to the `linux` target.
* **`darwin`**: Builds the Go binary for Darwin (macOS) and creates a Docker image.
    
    * Tags the image similarly to the `linux` target.
* **`arm`**: Builds the Go binary for ARM architecture and creates a Docker image.
    
    * Tags the image with the registry, app name, version, operating system, and `arm` architecture.
* **`image`**: Builds a Docker image for the specified `TARGETOS` and `TARGETARCH`.
    
* **`push`**: Pushes the Docker image to the specified registry.
    
* **`clean`**: Cleans up the built binary and the latest Docker image.
    

#### Usage

To use this Makefile, run `make [command]` where `[command]` is one of the provided commands. For example, `make build` will build the Go binary for the specified `TARGETOS` and `TARGETARCH`.

#### Notes

* Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine to use the Docker-related commands.
* The Makefile assumes that the necessary Go tools (`gofmt`, `go get`, `golint`) are installed.
* The versioning uses Git tags and commit hashes, so appropriate tags should be set in the repository for accurate versioning.
* The `clean` command removes the most recent Docker image and may need to be used with caution.

This Makefile provides a comprehensive set of commands for managing the lifecycle of the `kbot` application, from development to deployment.
